## Phase Log

### 2026-04-10 — Phase 1 started
Kicked off Phase 1 (measure). Design doc committed on `import-perf` (sha `dc136b5`). Phase 1 implementation plan committed (sha `cbd3516`). Running log initialized (sha `2c6e57a`). Fixture directory reserved and gitignored (sha `d49560c`). Capture script added (sha `1b1320c`).

### 2026-04-11 — Tasks 5-7 complete: PerfLogger wired into import hot path

Added `Option<PerfLogger>` to `ImportWorkerOptions` and threaded it through `import_chunk` → `normalize_jsonl_file` → `build_turns` → `build_actions` → `finalize_chunk_import` → `rebuild_chunk_{action,path}_rollups` via new `perf_logger` fields on `NormalizeJsonlFileParams` and `BuildActionsParams`. Spans emitted at each phase: `import.chunk`, `import.normalize_jsonl` (+ `import.normalize_history_jsonl`), `import.build_turns`, `import.build_actions`, `import.finalize_chunk`, `import.rebuild_action_rollups`, `import.rebuild_path_rollups`. Opt-in via `GNOMON_PERF_LOG`. Added manual `Debug` impl to `PerfLogger` so it can live inside derived-`Debug` structs. Committed as sha `2a3a47a`. Quality gates: fmt/clippy/tests all clean.

### 2026-04-11 — Task 4 complete: corpus captured

Ran `tests/fixtures/import-corpus/capture.sh` against the live `~/.claude/projects`. Results recorded in Corpus Snapshot header above. Manifest committed (sha `9b1bd73`). Tarballs are local-only (gitignored).

**Finding — subset sizing.** The subset ended up at 48% of the full corpus by uncompressed bytes (748 MiB vs 1.55 GiB), not the intended ~5%. Cause: the largest project alone is 748 MiB, which exceeds both the 5% target (≈77 MiB) and the 100 MiB cap, and the selection rule takes whole projects only — so the loop picks that one project and stops.

Implications:
- Fast-iteration speedup from subset is much smaller than planned (~2×, not ~20×).
- Subset shape is "one giant project" rather than "a representative slice of the corpus distribution."
- Subset is still useful: it exercises the largest-project hot path (which is where most cold-import time lives anyway), and it's still smaller than full.
- Full-corpus runs remain authoritative either way.

Options to revisit (not fixing now):
- (a) Accept as-is — subset tests the hot-project shape.
- (b) Rewrite subset selection to "smallest projects first until target" — gives ~77 MiB of many small projects, tests the tail.
- (c) Rewrite to "include 2-3 medium-sized projects near the median" — needs a median computation.
- (d) Keep current subset as `subset-large.tar.zst`, add a second `subset-small.tar.zst` with option (b) — both served by the same harness via a flag.

Decision: defer to user checkpoint (Task 13) after baselines are in hand. If the subset run time on full mode is acceptable (<30s wall), the current subset is fine for iteration.

## RESUME HERE (if session was reset, read this first)

Last updated: 2026-04-11 (end of Tasks 5-7)
Current phase: Phase 1 — measure
Current branch: `import-perf`
Current worktree: `/home/ketan/project/gnomon/.worktrees/import-perf`
Primary repo root (do not implement here): `/home/ketan/project/gnomon`

### How to resume
1. `cd /home/ketan/project/gnomon/.worktrees/import-perf`
2. Verify: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` → must print `import-perf`
3. Read this log's Phase Log (latest entries first) for context.
4. Read `docs/specs/2026-04-10-import-perf-design.md` if you need the big picture.
5. Read `docs/specs/2026-04-10-import-perf-phase1-plan.md` for the task list — you are between Task 7 and Task 8.
6. Continue at the "Next action" below.

### Last completed
Tasks 5-7 — PerfLogger wired into import hot path. Code commit sha `2a3a47a`. Spans emitted at every phase in the import pipeline. All quality gates pass.

### Next action
**Task 8 (Phase 1 plan):** Parse-vs-SQL split inside the per-record loop in `crates/gnomon-core/src/import/normalize.rs`. Add two local `Duration` accumulators (parse time vs SQL/process_record time) inside `normalize_transcript_jsonl_file`'s main loop, and emit one summary verbose span at end of loop — **not** per row. Full spec in `docs/specs/2026-04-10-import-perf-phase1-plan.md` starting at line 779. This is a separate commit from Tasks 5-7.

After Task 8, Tasks 9-12 are the benchmark harness and baseline captures. Task 13 is the first user checkpoint (review baseline, decide subset sizing).

### Uncommitted state
None. Working tree is clean on `import-perf`.

### Commits so far on `import-perf` (most recent last)
- `dc136b5` docs: add import performance optimization design
- `cbd3516` docs: add Phase 1 (measure) implementation plan
- `2c6e57a` log: initialize import perf running log
- `d49560c` chore: reserve tests/fixtures/import-corpus for perf snapshots
- `1b1320c` feat: add corpus capture script for import-perf benchmarks
- `9b1bd73` chore: commit import-corpus manifest for initial snapshot
- `2a3a47a` feat(import): wire PerfLogger into import hot path

### Target status
Not set (pending Task 14, which requires Task 10-12 baseline data).

### Candidate ranking
See design doc Section 4 for the initial ranking (Tier A: A1, A2a, A2b, A3, A4, A5; Tier B: B1-B5; Tier C: C1-C3). Live re-ranking starts in Phase 2 after the baseline profile is in hand.

### Open questions for user at next checkpoint
1. **Subset sizing.** Is the 48%-of-full single-project subset OK for iteration, or do we want to rewrite `capture.sh` to produce a second "small" subset (smallest-first selection)?
2. **Target number.** Depends on baseline data from Tasks 10-12.

### Session-resumption sanity check
If you're reading this after a context reset, run:
```
git -C /home/ketan/project/gnomon/.worktrees/import-corpus rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null
```
No — correct path:
```
cd /home/ketan/project/gnomon/.worktrees/import-perf
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
git log --oneline -10
ls tests/fixtures/import-corpus/
```
Expected: branch `import-perf`, 7 commits (design + plan + 5 log/chore/feat), `MANIFEST.md` + `full.tar.zst` + `subset.tar.zst` + `capture.sh` + `.gitkeep` present in fixtures dir.
